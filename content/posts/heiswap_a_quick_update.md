## Prelude

Woah! I wasn't expecting this level of attention on my [current side project - heiswap](https://kndrck.co/posts/introducing_heiswap/). Apologies to everyone who I didn't reply to on twitter, the amount of attention I got was a little bit overwhelming and hard to keep up with...

##### Just some guy retweeting my tweet

To anyone wondering how to pronounce the project name, its heiswap (hey-swap) :-)

## Updates
Just a couple quick updates on the project:

### UI Makeover

Thanks to the folks at [rimble from Consensys](https://twitter.com/MakingRimble), [heiswap](https://heiswap.exchange) now has modern fresh look!

### Relayers - Gasless Tx Now Possible!
It is now possible to withdraw your ETH from a fresh account with no funds! This is achieved through a relayer, a small fee will be paid out to the relayer to recompensate for GAS usage. 

You can either use the default relayer at `https://relayer.heiswap.exchange` or [deploy your own relayer](https://github.com/kendricktan/heiswap-relayer).

### Audits
Update: [Audit from Callisto Network is now fixed](https://github.com/kendricktan/heiswap-dapp/pull/15)

[Thanks to the Ethereum Commenwealth who is currently funding the auditing of the contract.](https://github.com/ethereumcommonwealth/Auditing/issues/321)

### Consensys Grants
Thanks to [Nick Addison](https://twitter.com/naddison) for bringing this to my attention, I've applied for the September batch of Consensys grants. The money will be used to support and update the web app and smart contract(s).

## Recap
Thank you, the awesome Ethereum community, this project has gone further than I would have ever imagined. Thank you all!
