## Prelude

For one of my (now retired) projects, I wanted to make use of a bunch of Instagram data, and so I scrapped them.

Amongst the scrapped data was all the cities in the world, along with the number of Instagram posts that 'tagged' that particular city.

I thought it would be cool to do a quick visualization of the data, and so I did.

## Most Instagrammed Cities

Should you wish to play around with the extracted data or create your own visualization, I've made the tools and data available [here](https://github.com/kendricktan/visualizing-worlds-most-grammed-cities).
